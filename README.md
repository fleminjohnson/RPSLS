# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game

## Overview

This Unity project is a variation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game called Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. It features a simple and fun gameplay experience where you compete against the CPU (or display) in a series of rounds. The game includes a main menu, a game screen with the CPU's move display, and five player move buttons representing the game's five states: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock. The game logic is implemented in C#.
